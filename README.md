# WiCompanion-PC

This is an implementation made for handling commands that are received from [WiCompanion-Mobile](https://github.com/MohZ13/WiCompanion-Mobile).
It also acts as a command handler. The received commands are then processed and executed by it. It is made only for Windows though you can develop it on any platform.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on your system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Java SE 7 Update 6](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html) or later version of it installed on your PC as specified on [this page](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/system_requirements_2-2/jfxpub-system_requirements_2-2.htm).
You can get latest version of JDK [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Also, perform last two steps specified in [Deployment](https://github.com/MohZ13/WiCompanion-PC#deployment).
